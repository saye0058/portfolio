The process was a long and stressful one. I ran into many problems along the way, from many errors I could not figure out how to fix, to starting something only for a few minutes later realize I needed to add more to HTML for it to work and my hamburger menu taking me approximately 6 hours. I eventually figured out that all I was missing for the hamburger menu was symbols. How I over came these obstacles was lots of time away from the code to come back with fresh eyes. I have learned that I need a better grasp of bootstrap and accessibility standards.

Some things I used were.
-Animate.css (backInDown on the H1)
-REM from google fonts.
-map from google maps.
-a variety of YouTube videos when I forgot how to do something.
